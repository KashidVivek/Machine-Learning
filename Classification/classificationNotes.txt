Classfication to predict the category of data using multiple features
Types of Classification algorithms:
Naive bayes
Decision Trees
Neural Networks
Support vector machines
K nearest Neighbors

#K nearest Neighbors
Takes bunch of label points to determine the class of new point
Algo;
1. Pick K
2. Calculate distance from new unknowm case from all cases
3. Slect K observations near unknown data point 
4. Predict label using most popular response value


distance : Euclidean

Jaccard Index:
y:actual label
y_hat: predicted label
jaccard index = intx/ symm diff

F1 score: Confusiom matrix
[[TP,FN]
 [FP,TN]]

 precision: acuuracy = tp/ tp+fp
 recall = tp / tp+fn
 f1 score: Harmonic avg of precision and recall

 log loss:
 measures the performance of a classifier where
the predicted output is a probability value between 0 and 1.
